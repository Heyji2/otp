    This library implements the Time-based One Time Password RFC 6238 with an HMAC-SHA1 algorithm and a 6 digits code. 
    It relies on the Cryptokit library for cryptography operations, as well as the Base32 library for base32 encoding. 
    The library generates a QR Code with the qrc library.
    It is tested against all test vectors provided in RFC 6238 and the test suite provides as well a dynamic test 
    which requires the use of an client authenticator (like Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator) as a final
    test. 

    # Get Started

    There are two phases to setup an OTP : 
    1. the registration : that's where a secret is shared by the server to the client. 
    2. the authentication : that's when the client enters the 6 digits code to authenticate. 

    ## Registration 
    On the server side : 
    
    ```
    let rng = Cryptokit.Random.secure_rng in             create a random generator                                                            
    let s = generate_secret rng in                       generate a secret                                                                    
    let u = generate_totp_uri "MyWebSite" s "Michel" in  embeds this secret into a specificaly crafted URI that authenticators can understand 
    let qr = Otp.uri2qrcode u in                         transform this URI into a QRCode that can be display in an html page                 
    let file = open_out "test.html" in 
    let fmt = Format.formatter_of_out_channel file in 
    let () = Format.fprintf fmt 
        "<html>
            <head></head>
            <body>
              <h1> TOTP QRCode </h1> %s
            </body>
          </html>" qr in 
    let () = Format.pp_print_flush fmt () in 
    let () = close_out file in 
    let () = print_endline "\nOpen the file test.html and scann the QRCode with a client OTP (like Microsoft Authenticator)" 
    ```
    

    ## Authentication 
    Then for the authentication : 
    
    ```
    print_endline "Enter the six digit code to authenticate Michel on MyWebSite"
    let code = read_line () in 
    if ((String.length code) != 6) then 
      print_endline "Error, the code must have 6 and only 6 digits" 
    else 
      let digits = Int32.to_int (Int32.of_string code) in  
      let c = totp_counter () in 
      let r = verify s c digits in
      match r with 
      |   Result.Error e -> print_endline e 
      |   Result.Ok resync -> Printf.printf "The code is good, Michel is authenticated on MyWebSite. Drift : %d steps" resync 
    ```

val generate_secret : ?nb_bits:int -> Cryptokit.Random.rng -> string
(**
    Generates a random string of nb_bits bits. If nb_bits is not a multiple of 8, the length of the
    string is rounded to the nearest integer toward 0. 
    nb_bits : number of bits of the generated secrets. Default to 160 bits. Must be a multiple of 8
    rng     : a random generator, as for instance, provided by Cryptokit.Randome.secure_rng 
 *)

val generate_totp_uri : ?algo:string -> ?nb_digits:int -> ?period:uint64 -> string -> string -> string -> string
(**
    [generate_totp_uri algo nb_digits period label secret issuer]
    Generates an uri following the {{: https://github.com/google/google-authenticator/wiki/Key-Uri-Format} Key Uri Format}
    @param algo Only support SHA1 (as most of authenticator clients) which is the default
    @param nb_digits Number of digits of the generated one-time-password. The default is 6 digits
    @param period The time step equivalent of the counter increment in second. Default value is 30 seconds, as in most authenticator clients. Refered to as "X" in the RFC 6238.  
    @param label A name for the client's account which registers an OTP for. 
    @param secret The secret to be shared with the authenticator client. 
    @param issuer The name of the issuer of the OTP. (e.g. the name of the website)
 *)
 
val totp_counter : ?period:uint64 -> ?t0:uint64 -> ?drift:uint64 -> unit -> counter
(**
   Generates a counter to be used in the time-based one time password procedure 
   with a secret to {!verify} a given code. The counter can also be incremented 
   using the function {!Core.increment}. 
   @param period The time step equivalent of the counter increment in seconds. Default 
   value is 30 seconds, as in most authenticator clients. Refered to as "X" in 
   the RFC 6238.  
   @param t0 The Unix time to start counting time steps (default value is 0, i.e., the 
   Unix epoch) and is also a system parameter. 
   @param drift This parameter account for a possible clock drifts between a client and 
   a validation server. This drift is the maximum number of backward time step to 
   from which the verification process must start with. The total number of steps
   (or increments) that will be used to check a given code/digits is the threshold 
   argument of the {!verify} function.  
   @return A counter to be use with a secret to verify a code/digits. 
 *)

val verify : ?threshold:int -> string -> counter -> int -> (int,string) result
(**
   [verify threshold secret counter digits] verifies that the digits are correct 
   given the secret and the counter, by computing the digits and comparing them with 
   the one provided.
   @param threshold Synchronization threshold corresponding to the maximum number of 
   successive increments and verifications tried until concluding the digits are 
   not correct. Default value is seuil_synchro.
   @param secret The secret initially shared with the authenticator client and used to 
   compute the digits on the server side. 
   @param counter The counter used to compute the digits. It should be provided by the 
   [totp_counter] function. 
   @param digits The digits to be verified, provided by the authenticator client. 
   @return {!Result.Ok} with an integer mentioning the number of successive 
   increments of the counter that have been needed to validate the digits (drift).
   This number must be less then {!seuil_synchro}. Should not be more than 
   2 for well synchronised clocks and no latency on the network. {!Result.Error} 
   otherwise with a message indicating "Invalid code".  

 *)

val uri2qrcode : string -> string
(**
   Transforms an uri provided by {!generate_totp_uri} into a 50x50 mm2 qrcode
   embedded into an html svg element (container) that can be imported into
   any html page.
